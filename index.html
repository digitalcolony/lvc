                <div class="bio-content">
                    <p>Born Clarence LeRoy Van Cleef Jr. in 1925, Lee Van Cleef served on a minesweeper in WWII before finding his calling in acting. With his sharp, angular features and piercing gaze, he was destined for the screen.</p>
                    <p>Though he started with small villainous roles in Hollywood classics like <em>High Noon</em>, it was his journey to Italy that made him a legend. Sergio Leone saw something in him—a dangerous charisma that could rival even Clint Eastwood.</p>
                    <p>From the ruthless "Angel Eyes" to the sophisticated Colonel Mortimer, Van Cleef redefined the Western antagonist, bringing a cool, calculated intensity that has never been matched since.</p>
